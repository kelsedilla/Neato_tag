# Neato_tag
F25 Computational Robotics Final Project

Play tag using two Neato vacuum robots. One is the runnner and can be controlled by teleop, and the other is the chaser, who autonomously follows and attempts to tag the runner.

## Requirements
- ROS2

## Running the Code

First, build.
- ```colcon build --symlink-install --packages-select neato_node2 neato_tag```
- ```source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash```

Then run:
```probably a bash script```
